                <p>The Elements of AI is a series of free online courses created by Reaktor and the University of Helsinki. Developed with the aim to encourage as broad a group of people as possible to learn what AI is, what can (and can’t) be done with AI, and how to start creating AI methods. The courses combine theory with practical exercises and can be completed at your own pace.</p>

          <p>
            I started with this course named “Elements of AI” by Google and University of Helsinki. Now to give a brief about the course I will say that it is not like most of the AI tech courses that we usually find on the internet. The course was somewhere above then teaching the algorithms and definitions about the field, it was trying to dig up into the part of the field where we are trying to modify our brain in a manner in which it becomes quite obvious for us upon how to develop and use and AI algorithm in any problem and what are the best choices we can make to optimize our ML model at its highest. The course also talked about the misconceptions that are created in the society regarding the harms that technology of AI is bringing and on the other hand it also talked about the actual disadvantages of excessive integration of AI in our society. So let me start with introducing the manner in which I see AI, cause there can be no particular definition that can suit every thought related to AI tech, here I am sharing the one which I think suits the best. Now according to me AI work can be divided in three parts:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>The Coding End:</strong> Here we have to write down the classic derived algorithms. Now this part is not only limited to writing code but we also optimize code and also choose the best algorithm for a specified problem.</li>
              <li><strong>The Mathematical End:</strong> So this part works more on deriving new algorithms or maybe improving the existing algorithms, It deals with creating equations in which coders take input and train their model upon.</li>
              <li><strong>The Biological/Psychological End:</strong> This is the part which compares AI tech with the human thinking system, this somewhere brings about the inspiration to new AI algorithms that are more realistic and generally give better results.</li>  
          </ul>
          <p>
            Else then this there were many other things that I have perceived from the course, some of which are listed below:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>There are two types of algorithms, particular and general, as the name suggests particular algo is problem specific while general problem is what suits for all the problems, we have succeeded in developing some fantastic particular AI algo but aren’t able to achieve the same in case of General Algorithms.</li>
              <li>Data is one of the really important pillars in tech and at least at the coding end it is the biggest task to analyze and process the data.</li>
              <li>The rumors about AI taking over the world is just a fantasy right now as for an AI to take over humans or doing tasks like us it should be able to work accurately on all day to day problems that we face which is more like a dream for now.</li>
              <li>AI still is harmful in other manners. AI is still used by giant market holders to manipulate everyone in any particular direction, maybe towards a particular service or towards a particular product.</li>
              <li>Nowadays, AI is not suggesting to us what we want to see instead it is manipulating us towards what we should see.</li>
              <li>The ideal goal for AI development should be to use it more for the betterment of society and this should be accessible to everyone so that there will be less manipulation by giants. The AI can relate to human psychology and thus can also be used to bring positivity and equality within the society.</li>
          </ul>
